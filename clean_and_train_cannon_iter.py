# how to clean the training set?
# if I were to write a script...
# (1) compute delta chisq of training set
# (2) remove ones with delta chisq>100 from training set df
# (3) re-train the cannon
# (4) compute delta chisq of cleaned training set, but it will need new single star model

# can I write some code that takes in a model
# updates the training set 
# and re-trains?
# that actually might not be too challenging with the model object.
